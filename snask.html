<h1>Darling Snask,</h1>
<p>Here be some fine booty! Watch and feel your eyeballs peel with excitment. My name is Amos Marsters, I am indeed a Graphic Designer. Perhaps a meeting I would be able to
  dance with words and you can listen to my parlance in realtime, and I yours. I am in search of a placement, an internship, a coop, for my program and why did I choose to ask you.
  In November of 2016 I went to Toronto Canada and by chance stumbled into your Speech at Design Thinkers. You did things differently, you did things well, but you did things genuinely, and
  that requires balls. I think I have some balls, I think we could share balls and do ballsy things together. In March I will be embarking on a plane and I hope I will be coming to
  Stockholm Sweden in refuge of Snask. I dearly would like to talk with you and learn the way of the purple dinosaur. I look forward to hearing back from you.
  Amos Marsters
